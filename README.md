# Kotlin/JS talk

Code and slides for my Kotlin/JS talk. The talk gives an introduction into Kotlin/JS. In particular the following topics are covered:

- Short introduction into Kotlin
- Getting started with Kotlin/JS
- JavaScript interoperability
- Backend integration
- React
- Fritz2 & PatternFly

The slides are available at XXX

## Code

The code is divided into the following independent projects. The projects are self contained and can be used as-is. Each project includes a short readme how to get started.  

1. `getting-started`

1. `jsinterop`
2. `backend`
3. `react`
4. `patternfly`

In case you're wondering about the Gradle project names, they all start with  `kjst-` which stands for **K**otlin/**JS** **t**alk.
