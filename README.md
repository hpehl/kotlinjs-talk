# Kotlin/JS talk

Slides and code of my Kotlin/JS talk. The talk gives an introduction into Kotlin/JS. In particular the following topics are covered:

- Short introduction into Kotlin
- Getting started with Kotlin/JS
- Kotlin/JS ecosystem
- JavaScript interoperability
- React
- Fritz2 & PatternFly

The slides are available at [slides.pdf](slides.pdf).

## Examples

Code samples are divided into the following independent projects. The projects are self contained and can be used as-is. Each project includes a short readme how to get started.  

1. [getting-started](getting-started/README.md)
2. [ecosystem](ecosystem/README.md)
3. [jsinterop](jsinterop/README.md)
4. [react](react/README.md)
5. [patternfly](patternfly/README.md)

In case you're wondering about the Gradle project names, they all start with  `kjst-` which stands for **K**otlin/**JS** **t**alk.
